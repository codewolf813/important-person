    <p>Everyone has an important person to them. That person can inspire the person to attempt to be
      the best that they can be. That person is my wife Kat Day! She has been an inspiration in all
      aspects of my life! Here are the reasons why:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>She was there as a friend when most people would not look at me.</li>
      <li>She helped me realize that I could purse the passion in my life, coding.</li>
      <li> She has given birth to our two wonderful children!
        <ul>
          <li>Sean: My loud and loveable toddler!</li>
          <li>Abby: The most smiley baby in the world!</li>
        </ul>
      <li>She is not afraid to tell me the truth when I need it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Thank you for reading about my most important person!</p>
