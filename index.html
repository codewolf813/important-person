    <p>Everyone has an important person to them. That person can inspire the person to attempt to be
      the best that they can be. That person is my wife <strong>Kat Day</strong>! She has been an inspiration in all
      aspects of my life! Here are the reasons why:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>She was there as a friend when most people would not look at me.</li>
      <li>She helped me realize that I could purse the passion in my life, coding.</li>
      <li> She has given birth to our two wonderful children!
        <ul>
          <li>Sean: My loud and loveable toddler!</li>
          <li>Abby: The most smiley baby in the world!</li>
        </ul>
      <li>She is not afraid to tell me the truth when I need it.</li>
    </ol>
